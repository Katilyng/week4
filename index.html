        <p>Hello! I am currently a student at Minnesota State University – Mankato. I am a double majoring with a BFA in Graphic Design and a BS in Gender and Women’s Studies. I am also working on becoming a sexual assault advocate. I believe that art plays a very important role in current events, as well as bringing attention to social issues that may be over looked.  </p> 
    
    <p>I grew up in a small town in Southwest Minnesota and went to the county school. During high school I also took PSEO classes through Southwest Minnesota State in Marshall and Minnesota West in Worthington. After high school I attended The Art Institutes International  Minnesota, but later transferred to Mankato State. I currently work at Cinemark as the assistant manager and I am an officer for College Democrats, an RSO here on campus. I also own a fat cat named Falcon who has been enjoying quartentine life, as I am around <em>all</em> the time.</p>
    
    <p>In for the future I hope to combine my interests of social justice and art. I want to create thought provoking pieces that could cause change within a few individuals, but hopefully on a larger scale. One day, I will attain a masters and possibly a doctorate degree. </p>
